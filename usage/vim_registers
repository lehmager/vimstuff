Record to Register
------------------

qx                      Record typed characters into register x, where x is from {0-9a-z"} .
			(uppercase to append).

q			Stops recording.


@-Functions
-----------
@x                      Execute the contents(commands) of register x, where x is from [a-z] .

   sample
      Define @-function swapping current line for next line.

      First solution:
         While in normal mode type in current line "qaddpq" (without the enclosing double quotes)
         This records the string ddp to register a. You may verify this fact by entering :reg a
      
      Second solution:
         Write the string ddp to a separate line. Position cursor to begin of line and enter the string
         "byw
         thus mapping the string ddp to register b .
      
      Third solution:
         Write the string ddp to a separate line. Now mark this string in visual mode and yank to register c
         entering "cy while in visul mode.

      Now entering @a or @b or @c in normal mode will swap lines.
